# Summary

Term project for CS701 was focused on understanding a frontend framework (Angular) and how to utilize Node.js to manage packages. 

The application focused primarily on accepting form data from users and converting it into two tables: History and History-Details Components. Services were integrated throughout the project to tie together components, process data, and handle requests from users.

Ionic framework was utilized to support mobile compatability and incorporate tabs for future features.

With no backend experience at the time, localstorage was used to store data and test the application's capabilities.
